###< How to calculate ROA, ROE, ROIC>###
- ROA (Return on asset)  : How well the company is using its assets. What amount of net income its generating per Dollar of assets they have.
    - Net Income / Average Total Asset
- ROE (Return on equity) : How efficiently the company is using its equity to generate after tax profit.
    - Net Income / Average Shareholder's Equity
- ROIC (Return on investment capital): = (Net Income After Tax â€“ Dividend) / (Total Debt + Equity)
                                       = Net Profit After Tax / Total Capital
    * Total Capital = Debt (loan), Share holders equity aka company buying own shares

- What is Asset, Equity, and Liability?
    - Asset = Equity + Liability
- Assets are resources controlled by the firm (cash, gold, equipments, ...). Don't think who controls those resources.
- Liabilities are current obligations of the firm. Which the firm would repay one day.
- Equity (net asset) is the residual claim owners have on assets of the firm. Only owners asset after paying all the liabilities. If something bad happens, creditors will take away their resources, whatever is left is the equity. Equity = Asset - Liability.

###< Key Concepts >###

**< PE Ratio >**
**< PB Ratio >**
- Equity per Share (aka Book Value)
- PB Ratio = Current share price / Equity per share
    - less than 1 = less than actual asset price (aka good share)
    - more than 1 = greater than actual asset price (aka bad share)

**< ROIC Ratio >**
How much profit the company made per Cash cycle multiplied by how many Cash cycles the company makes per year.
- Cash Cycle: _Rais capital_ -> _Make investment_ -> _Run operation_ -> _Return capital_ to the investors
    The time period a company needs to generate profit after taking investments from investors.
    How much you make and how long it takes to make it.

* Revenue = Total sales
* Profit  = Revenue - expenses

- Cash Cycle per Day = (Invested Capital / Annual Revenue) / 365
- ROIC = ( 365 / Cycle time (days) ) * Profit

1. Avoid small cap business
1. Focus on Mid or Higher cap business

2. During Bull market invest in _cyclical stocks_
2. During Bear market invest in _defensive stocks_

3. Net income growth for the last 3 years should be positive and the last years net income growth should be more than 20%

4. Sales Revenue should go similarly as Net income

5. Operating Cash Flow must be positive, stable and growing

6. Earnings per share should grow for the last 3 years for at least 10%
6. Earnings per share of current quarter should grow 20% from the same quarter in the last year

7. Return on equity should be > 12% for the last 3-5 years
7. Return on equity should be > 15% on the previous year

8. Long term Debt should be less than 3 X Free cash flow
8. Current debt ratio should be > 1.5

9. Future prospects: MOATf

10. PEG (price to earning to growth) ratio: should be <= 1.0
    - PEG Ratio < 1  : Undervalued
    - PEG Ratio == 1 : Fairly valued
    - PEG Ratio > 1  : Overvalued

11. Intrinsic value:
    - Intrinsic value > Current share price = Undervalued share
    - Intrinsic value < Current share price = Overvalued share

12. Insider action: If insiders/the company itself is selling the share... don't buy that


**< Check Dividend Yield as well >**
- PEG Ratio = P/E Ratio / Estimated EPS Growth Rate
- PEGY Ratio = P/E Ratio / (Estimated EPS Growth Rate + Dividend Yield)
- PEGY Ratio = PEG Ratio X (1 / Dividend Yield)
    - PEGY Ratio must be <= 1
* If the company gives high dividend yield (> 8%) this formula doesn't work. Avoid high dividend yield company anyways.

**< Discount Rate >**
- Discount Rate = (MV of Equity / Total MV of Debt & Equity) X Re + (MV of Debt / Total MV of Debt & Equity) X Rd
- Re =
- Rd =
- MV = Market Value = Market Cap = Current share price * Shares Outstanding

**< Margin Of Safety >**
- Margin of safety = 1 - (Current share price / Intrinsic value)
- OR
- Margin of safety = Intrinsic value X (1 - Margin of safety)
- Intrinsic Value = (Present value + Terminal value + Cash - Debt) / Total number of shares outstanding
-
